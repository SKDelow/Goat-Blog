<p>The American Pygmy is an American breed of achondroplastic goat. 
    It is small, compact and stockily built. Like the Nigerian Dwarf, 
     it derives from the West African Dwarf group of breeds of West Africa.
      Between 1930 and 1960, animals of this type were imported to the United States
      for use either as zoo animals or for research; some were later kept and bred as
       companion animals and established as a breed in 1975.It may also be known as the 
       Pygmy or African Pygmy. It is quite different and separate from the British Pygmy breed.</p>
