<p>Raising goats will be easier if you understand how goats think and how they live. 
    If that statement sounds absurd to you, then you have much to learn about livestock 
    in general and goats in particular. Learn how to accomplish your goals by modifying your
     management techniques to take advantage of goats’ habits and behaviors. Working with them
      is much easier than trying to bend their instincts to your wishes. Goats are herd animals.
       Having few defenses — they are sprinters, not long-distance runners, and their horns
        provide limited protection — goats are prey for many other species. The herd means
         safety and each goat must be able to keep up with it. A goat separated from its herd is
          a potentially dead animal. An injured or sick goat will quit eating and leave the herd
           to hasten its death so it doesn’t draw predators to its herdmates, while the healthy
            members will cast out a sick animal to save the rest of the group.
